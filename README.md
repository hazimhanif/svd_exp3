# Experiment 3-AST Neural Network (Replication & Application)

This repo is for the replication and application of ASTNN to represent source code for a software vulnerability detection task.

## Abstract Syntax Tree Neural Network
* Developed and implemented by Zhange et. al (2019) [A Novel Neural Source Code Representation based on Abstract Syntax Tree](https://github.com/zhangj111/astnn). 
* They presented the work in ICSE 2019.
* Acquired good results for source code classification and code clone detection.
* The code clone detection works for all types of clones (Type 1  - 4 )
* No known implementation of the proposed source code representation method for software vulnerability detection.
* This is an exploratory application experiment

## Datasets
Code clone detection:
1. `Open Judge`
2. `Big Code Bench (BCB)` 

Source code classification:
1. Some other dataset.

Software vulnerability detection:
1. Will upload later
